 Every integer number n is represented in positional number system of base r by a sequence of digits 0 ≤ di < r, so the value is equal to:
n = d0  + r * d1 + r2 * d2 + r3 * d3 + ...
Your task is to convert a given number in r-base represantation into s-base representation, for example: decimal 231 into binary 11100111. Assume that r ≤ 36 and the digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
