 Every integer number n is represented in positional number system of base r by a sequence of digits 0 ≤ di < r, so the value is equal to:
n = d0  + r * d1 + r2 * d2 + r3 * d3 + ...
Your task is to convert a given number in r-base represantation into s-base representation, for example: decimal 231 into binary 11100111. Assume that r ≤ 36 and the digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### 2. NWW

Given are n natural numbers a1, ..., an. Find the least common multiple of these numbers, i.e. the smallest natural number M such that for each i the number ai divides M without a remainder.

Entry
The first line shows the number of tests.

For each test, the number n is given first, and then in the next line of the number a1 ..., an.

It can be assumed that both the numbers ai and the result are in the range [1..264-1].

### 3.Dodawanie

directory dodawanie

This exercise was an external (not from spoj) exercise. Given are 2 numbers of unlimited length. Add those numbers. Because of the unlimited length the numbers have to be converted from string to a number and then added digit by digit.
